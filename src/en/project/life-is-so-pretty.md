This game was done for the [2016 spring Lisp game jam](https://itch.io/jam/spring-2016-lisp-game-jam) hosted on itch.io.

We started late and only had five days to make the whole of it.

Graphics were done by [Reptifur][reptifur].

The general ambiance and texts were written by [Lizenn][lizenn].

This is my second game written in CHICKEN Scheme (the first being [Crepes-party-hard-yolo-swag 2015](cphys2015.xhtml))

Released on the 12th of may 2016, itâ€™s available on [itch.io](https://kooda.itch.io/life-is-so-pretty).
