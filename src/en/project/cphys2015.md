This game has been done in the context of teaching Scheme to my intern in December 2015.

The graphics and music have been made by [Reptifur][reptifur].

It has been released on the Itch.io platform at: [https://kooda.itch.io/cphys2015](https://kooda.itch.io/cphys2015)

It’s the very first polished game I ever made, and the very first completed game I made using CHICKEN Scheme.

It has been a very pleasant experience, it took approximately a month to build.
