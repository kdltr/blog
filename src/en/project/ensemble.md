A simple client for the [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org/) protocol.

Being fed up by [Riot](https://riot.im/), the main Matrix client, I decided to start my own.

The goal is to have a featureful client, with a lean interface, that doesn’t require a web browser and is easy on the computer’s resources. It will feature a console interface as well as a very simple GUI.

Beware! For now, this software is alpha quality at best!

Latest version: **0.4**
