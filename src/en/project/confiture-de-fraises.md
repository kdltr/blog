**This game is intended for a mature audience!**

This is my entry for the [Strawberry Jam 2][strawberry jam] that took place on February 2018, itâ€™s a one month long game jam about horny video games.

This game has been made in about 6 days, working on it on and off.

I experimented with run time sound synthesis, the game generates its sounds and music while running and I made a very bad MIDI file parser to help programming the music synthesis.

The graphics were drawn by me in 30 minutes with a barely working mouse.

The music was composed by [Hiro Lynx][hiro].

This game features three different endings, one of which being *REALLY* difficult to get.
