((title . "Perception Saga")

Perception Saga is my very first game jam project.

It was done for the [Global Game Jam 2014][ggj] with [Jobastre],
see the [related submission].

The theme of this edition was “We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.”

It has been released on the 19th of October 2015 on Itch.io at
[https://kooda.itch.io/perception-saga](http://kooda.itch.io/perception-saga)

Perception Saga is a strange synesthetic adventure to a land of abstract sounds and visual effects.
It is also accessible to hearing or visually impaired people.

It’s only a game jam prototype so there is only 3 levels of increasing difficulty.

It is advised to play it in a calm environment, with good headphones.
