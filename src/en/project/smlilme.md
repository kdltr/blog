**Requires a gamepad to play**

A little game made for the [Autumn 2018 Lisp Jam](https://itch.io/jam/autumn-lisp-game-jam-2018). Its entry page is [here](https://itch.io/jam/autumn-lisp-game-jam-2018/rate/322465).

This was my very first game where I used OpenGL directly, since I didn’t have much experience around that I struggled to get simple things done and had little time to make the mechanics or level design better.

I also took some time to compose and record a little piece of music for it, with help from [Lizenn](http://twitter.com/just_lizenn) and [Reptifur](https://repti.fr/).

Artworks were done by Reptifur.
