LSDPad is my second game jam project.

Not unlike [Perception Saga](perception-saga.xhtml)
it was done during the [Global Game Jam 2015][ggj] with [Jobastre].

See the jam entry here: [http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/lsdpad](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/lsdpad)

The jam’s theme was “What do we do now?”

LSDPad is an experiment prototype.
It’s an interactive and collaborative text editor integrating various quirks.

The goal of this odd toy is to find as many of the achievements it proposes as possible.
