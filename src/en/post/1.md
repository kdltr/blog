Hey, you’re already there!

_Quickly hides the dust under a carpet._

Welcome! I hope you’ll enjoy yourself here and that you’ll find
some seeds to feed your mind! Even though, at the time of writing,
there’s not much to see yet. It still smells like fresh paint!



# Why

I already attempted, a few years back, to write in a blog, but did not
have much succes doing it. It had only two posts. Only one was more or
less worthy of interest, and I still find it not that badly written
today. I suppose it’s a good sign!

If you’re interested, it’s still available [around here][old-blog].

Why reattempt it then, if I wasn’t really able to succeed the first
time? It’s because of these two articles:

The first, even though it dates from 2005, convinced me that I, too,
should try to write on the Internet. Without real ambition nor
regularity nor anything else, just write for the sake of it. By the
way, you too, [you should write blogs][you-should-write-blogs].

The second one [is an article from an Iranian blogger published a few
days ago][the-web-we-have-to-save], which relates his release from
prison, and the world he finds after 6 years of absence. A good
summary of what is happening to the Internet today… and sadly it’s not
very pretty. His point joins with the actions of the [FDN
Feneration][ffdn], and of the old Benjamin Bayard’s conferences on
[the Internet as Minitel 2.0][minitel2] (in French).



# What kind of content

A lot of things, I hope!

For now I plan to write my reflexions on diverse subjects, everything
that dawns in my head. Expound my knowledge and my ideas, with or
without future developments, we’ll see!


I also plan to write on technical stuff. By writing tutorials, for
example. Especially on Lisp, functional and logic languages… And also
by presenting my current projects.

It will certainly often be related to Scheme. I use and contribute as
much as I can to the [CHICKEN][chicken] project, and I intend to start
hacking on the compiler. With a bit of luck, some of these hacks will
be useful!

You will also find, if I do not procrastinate too much, some stories
and fictions on this blog. And even some music or other artistic work.



# How is it done?

Given the previous paragraph, you probably suspect it… I use Scheme a
lot so the software behind this blog is indeed written in Scheme.

The software itself is [Hyde][hyde], a program from the CHICKEN
project which enables me to generate the nice web pages you see when
browsing this site! Thanks to it, I don’t have anything else to do
but to type my text.

By the way, I made it so that the website should be very lightweight
for fast load times, and accessible for multiple disabilities. If by any
chance it’s not the case, please let me know!

We will stop there because I’ve been buttonholing you for quite some
time now, I hope the next articles will interest you. Do not hesitate
to contact me if you have the slightest remark. See you!
