A few weeks ago, I was at a friend’s, and started up my custom IRC client to get in touch with someone.
An hour or so later, my battery was already almost depleted, though I usually get many hours of battery life with this laptop.

I don’t usually go on IRC when traveling with my laptop, that’s why I thought something was wrong about it.

To investigate the issue, I used the `powertop` utility, here is a screenshot of it with the IRC client running.

From this screenshot we can see that the `pty irc-read -n +1 -f out` process is waking the CPU a *lot* (nearly 600 times per second).
This prevents it from going into deeper sleep modes, thus consuming more energy overall.

This little program is indeed a part of my IRC client, you can see its source code [right here](/cgit.cgi/config/tree/scripts/irc-read?id=ef8181de2fe3b6df1fbf64e3dc67b62bd2652ee9).

To understand what was going wrong, I used `strace` on one instance of this program, and found out that the `tail` utility was behaving strangely.

    stitch:~$ strace -p 4738
    strace: Process 4738 attached
    restart_syscall(<... resuming interrupted nanosleep ...>) = 0
    fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=589, ...}) = 0
    lseek(3, 0, SEEK_CUR)                   = 589
    read(3, "", 1024)                       = 0
    nanosleep({tv_sec=1, tv_nsec=0}, 0x7ffe37c0ba60) = 0
    fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=589, ...}) = 0
    lseek(3, 0, SEEK_CUR)                   = 589
    read(3, "", 1024)                       = 0
    nanosleep({tv_sec=1, tv_nsec=0}, 0x7ffe37c0ba60) = 0
    fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=589, ...}) = 0
    lseek(3, 0, SEEK_CUR)                   = 589
    read(3, "", 1024)                       = 0
    nanosleep({tv_sec=1, tv_nsec=0}, 0x7ffe37c0ba60) = 0
    …

What this trace reveals is that `tail -f` works by seeking to where we were in the file since last time and reading what’s new, every second (nanosleep with tv_sec = 1 and tv_nsec = 0).
This effectively wakes up the CPU once per second for every IRC channel I’m in, as one irc-read process is running per IRC channel.

I wasn’t happy with `tail -f` polling for changes every seconds like that since there are better solutions available.
That’s why I wrote my own version of `tail -f`, using the CHICKEN language and the inotify bindings wasamasa wrote a few weeks ago.

Here is the source code of my implementation:

    ;; tailf.scm
    (use inotify utils)
    
    (init!)
    (on-exit clean-up!)
    
    (define path (car (command-line-arguments)))
    (add-watch! path '(modify))
    
    (with-input-from-file path
      (lambda ()
        (let loop ()
          (display (read-all))
          (flush-output)
          (next-event!)
          (set-file-position! (current-input-port) 0 seek/cur)
          (loop))))

As you can see, it’s a very tiny program. Here I use inotify to wake the program as soon as the watched file is modified, I then seek to where I’m in the file (to avoid reading the end-of-file marker) and read everything that was added from here.

Sadly that wasn’t enough, `tail` was just a red herring, another process was waking the CPU up a **lot** more. This program was `pty`, a little utility from the Ma text editor, that makes it behave like a terminal emulator.

Lets look at his system calls trace:

    stitch:~$ strace -p 4668
    strace: Process 4668 attached
    restart_syscall(<... resuming interrupted nanosleep ...>) = 0
    poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}, {fd=3, events=POLLOUT}], 2, 100) = 1 ([{fd=3, revents=POLLOUT}])
    read(3, 0x7fff4a4f5290, 1023)           = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
    nanosleep({tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=10000000}, 0x7fff4a4f51c0) = 0
    poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}, {fd=3, events=POLLOUT}], 2, 100) = 1 ([{fd=3, revents=POLLOUT}])
    read(3, 0x7fff4a4f5290, 1023)           = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
    nanosleep({tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=10000000}, 0x7fff4a4f51c0) = 0
    poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}, {fd=3, events=POLLOUT}], 2, 100) = 1 ([{fd=3, revents=POLLOUT}])
    read(3, 0x7fff4a4f5290, 1023)           = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
    nanosleep({tv_sec=0, tv_nsec=10000000}, 0x7fff4a4f51c0) = 0
    …

Looks oddly familiar, right? Though this one wakes up the CPU every 10 milliseconds! (nanosleep with tv_nsec = 10000000).

It took me a while to understand what was wrong there, I didn’t understand why poll() was returning an event for fd 3, and reading from it was returning EAGAIN… The problem here is a bug of the `pty` utility!
It tries to **read** from a file descriptor when poll() tells the program that the file descriptor is ready for **writing**!

I made a little patch to fix this issue and make the program work without non-blocking file descriptors, and all is well now! :D (here is the [current code](/cgit.cgi/forks/ma/tree/pty.c))
