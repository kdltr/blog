((title . "What I’m doing these days"))

I’m currently at home, in Rennes.

These days I work a lot on Ensemble and CHICKEN Scheme, both will see
new stable releases very soon! Exciting!

I still play my cello, but I’m struggling. I’m not very happy about
my playing quality…

I started streaming on a schedule! You can [find me on
Picarto](https://picarto.tv/Kooda) every tuesday and thursday afternoon!

I still want to challenge myself to make a tiny video game every month,
I also think a lot about making minimalistic web apps that are very easy
to self-host and access. These will be far easier to make when CHICKEN
5.0 is out, as support for making static executables will be super easy.
