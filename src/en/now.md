((title . "What I’m doing these days"))

I’m currently at home, in Rennes.

I’m trying to focus on my health, that I’ve been neglecting for quite some time now…

I’ve not streamed in a while but I’d really like to get back to it, same goes for my cello.

I code a little bit every day, finding and fixing bugs for CHICKEN, and porting code to CHICKEN 5.
