((title . "What I’m doing these days"))

I’m currently at home, in Rennes.

These days I mainly work on CHICKEN Scheme to prepare the upcoming major release.
I also practice on my cello quite a bit, it keeps my mood up!

I plan to resume working on Ensemble soon, and get back to live-streaming.

I want to challenge myself to make a tiny video game every month, I also think a lot about making minimalistic web apps that are very easy to self-host and access.
