Welcome!

You just stumbled upon, probably by accident, my little personal
website.

I’m Adrien Ramos, also known as Kooda on the Internet (and sometimes
elsewhere). I’m a technology and libre software enthusiast.

I mainly develop in the [CHICKEN Scheme][chicken] language.

You can [read my blog][blog] if you feel like doing so. Otherwise you
can always go on your way and watch some [otter pictures][dailyotter].

I’m also available as a freelancer if you need a developer or a
teacher. Do not hesitate to contact me.


Contact
=======

I’m easily reachable via email and xmpp/jabber at the following
address: [kooda@upyum.com][mail].

I use twitter, you can find me at [@kdltr][kdltr]

I’m also often available on IRC, on the [freenode][freenode] network
under the nickname _Kooda_.
