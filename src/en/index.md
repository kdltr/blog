Welcome!

You just stumbled upon, probably by accident, on my little personal
website.

I’m Adrien Ramos, also known as Kooda on the Internet (and sometimes
elsewhere). I’m a technology and libre software enthusiast.

You can go [read my blog][blog] if you feel like doing so. Otherwise
you can always go on your way and watch some [otter pictures][dailyotter].

I’m also available as a freelancer if you need a developper or a
teacher, do not hesitate to contact me.


Contact
=======

I’m easily reachable via email and xmpp/jabber at the following
address: [kooda@upyum.com][mail].

I’m also often available on IRC, on the [freenode][freenode] network
under the nickname _Kooda_.
